* 🌱 I'm currently a Science Computer Student that always search for and do projects with some programming and markup languages, like _Python, Java, HTML, CSS and JS_; and, some day I was thinking: "Well, I have unuseful projects (joke 😂😂), and would like to share with my friends and any person around the world. What place can I do it??". I guess you know the answer, no? *GitHub!!!*

* 🤔 Nowadays, I share public projects here, post programming contents in my Instagram's Account: c0deplus (username) and I'm doing my own porfolio (when it is made, I gonna put the link here).

* 💬 Future Goal: even I studying Science Computer's Bacharel, when finish the course, I gonna study Data Science (I'm thinking about Computer's Vision, so, if you know some online courses about the area, I will be glad to know!!)
